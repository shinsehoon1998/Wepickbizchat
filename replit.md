## System Architecture
The project utilizes a modern web stack with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite for the frontend, and Vercel Serverless Functions for the backend. Data is managed with PostgreSQL (Neon) via Drizzle ORM, and authentication is handled by Supabase Auth (JWT-based). The UI is built using shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide Icons, with TanStack Query v5 for state management and Wouter for routing. Deployment is managed through Vercel.
